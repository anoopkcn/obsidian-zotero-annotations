# Zotero Annotations
Import PDF annotation notes and metadata from Zotero to Obsidian.

**This Plugin is not actively developed, for official plugins please check the end of this document. I would recomend using [mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration)**

## Requirements
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) `v6.x` with [Better BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) plugin installed.
    - Export BetterBibTeX JSON file from Zotero to Obsidian vault(Also, In BetterBibTeX settings select `On Change` option in the Automatic Export tab)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

## Installation
The plugin is not available in the community plugin section in Obsidian. So you have to install it manually.
### Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/anoopkcn/obsidian-zotero-annotations/releases) and unzip it.
2. Copy the `obsidian-zotero-annotations` folder to your vault's `.obsidian/plugins` folder.
3. Reload Obsidian.

You can also use the [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat/) plugin to install the latest release.

## Features
The plugin provides two commands:
![command modal](./images/zotero_annotations_command_modal.png)

1. The `Create or Update Note` will create a note in Obsidian with the metadata and annotations from Zotero. If there are no annotations file associated with a reference in Zotero this command will simply import the metadata. 
2. The `Update All Notes` by default will update all the notes according to the new annotations created in Zotero.  If set to `Create when missing` option in settings it will import and update all the references with annotation available in Zotero. 

**NOTE**: By default, Hotkeys are not set. 

Following is an example of the command `Create or Update Note`:
![reference modal](./images/zotero_annotations_reference_modal.png)
If you wish to change the default style, you can make a custom CSS(Obsidian settings-> Appearance -> CSS Snippets)

<details>
<summary>CSS Snippet for changing the modal view</summary>

```css
.zaTitle {
    /* my title style goes here */
}
.zaAuthors {
    /* my authors style goes here */
}
.zaCitekey {
    /* my citekey style goes here */
}
```
</details>

## Upcoming Features
- [ ] Command to insert reference ID and other metadata in a markdown note (can be used for [Reference Map plugin](https://github.com/anoopkcn/obsidian-reference-map))
- [ ] Command to cherry pick annotations from Zotero and insert it to current note

## Settings
By default, annotations are created with a plain template. You can provide a custom template by providing the path to the template using the `Template File` option in the settings.

## Related  or Similar Plugins
This work is inspired by the plugins mentioned in this section. I used all of them and didn't like some of the features. Or some functions that I wanted were not available. **So I decided to borrow some of their code** and make my own plugin. Thanks to the authors. Please try these plugins. They are great.
